## Sales Dashboard for Management
The management needed a dashboard to easy access all necessary information in one screen. Their main focus were:
    - Sales performance
    - Quantity sold
    - Stock in inventory
    - Target performance
    
I utilized Power BI to present the data in a tabular format as per the management's preferences, incorporating two Line Charts to facilitate visualizing progress and comparing data. The source data was obtained from an ERP system, and subsequently underwent cleansing, transformation, and modeling within Power BI. By employing DAX calculations to consolidate data from various sources, the management was able to conduct deeper analysis.

Moreover, this dashboard can be disseminated to sales personnel by means of user assignment and role-based access control, ensuring that they are granted access only to permissible data.
